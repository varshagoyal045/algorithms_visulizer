# Algorithm Visualizer - ReactJS Web App

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualizer ReactJS web app! This app enables you to visualize a variety of sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and maze generation algorithms. 

Try out the app here: [Live Demo](https://your-algorithm-visualizer-app-link.com)

## Sorting Algorithms

Visualize different sorting algorithms in action. Watch as the app brings sorting algorithms to life, including:
- Quick Sort
- Shell Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort

Customize the number of bars to sort and control the animation speed for a more immersive experience.

## Graphs and Maze Visualizations

Experience interactive 2D grid-based graph algorithms and maze generation. Features include:
- Drag and move the green starting square
- Drag the red ending square
- Place walls with left mouse button drag to create obstacles
- Use weights instead of walls for weighted pathfinding algorithms

Unweighted graph algorithms available:
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search

Weighted pathfinding algorithms available:
- Dijkstra
- A* Manhattan
- A* Diagonal
- A* Euclidean

Maze generation algorithms at your disposal:
- Recursive Maze
- Prim's Maze
- DFS Maze
- Binary Tree Maze
- Random Maze
- Random Weighted Maze
- Natural Terrain (generated using simplex noise)
- Image Terrain (convert an image into a maze)
- Webcam Terrain (use your webcam to create a maze)

Customize wall weight, grid size, and animation speed to suit your preferences. Click the **Reset Grid** button to clear out walls and weights, returning the grid to its initial state. Click the **Clear Visualization** button to stop and clear the visualization of any ongoing algorithm.

**Additional Graph Visualizer Features:**
- **Tutorial**: Access the tutorial guide from the bottom left corner.
- **Responsive Design**: Drag and resize the window, and the grid automatically adapts to the new dimensions.
- **Dynamic Points**: Drag around the starting and ending points while visualizing a pathfinding algorithm for an engaging effect.
